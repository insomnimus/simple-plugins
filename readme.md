# Simple Plugins
Bunch of simple CLAP plugins.

## Build Instructions
You need to have [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs/).

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/insomnimus/simple-plugins
cd simple-plugins
# If you can execute shell scripts:
./build.sh --release
# Or if you can run Powershell scripts:
./build.ps1 --release
# Otherwise, build plugins manually, one by one
# E.g.
# (the `cargo bundle` command is defined in .cargo/config.toml as an alias)
cargo bundle simple-clipper --release
cargo bundle  simple-gain --release
# ...and so on
```

After building, you can copy `.clap` files in `target/bundled/` to your CLAP plugin directory.
